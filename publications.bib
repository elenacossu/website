	abstract = {This paper discusses how the Latin American experience can help us understand contemporary  populism and its management. This topic starts from  the assumption that structural change and social  contexts help us explain the evolution of populism in  the same way they helped explain the evolution of  violence and management. To do so, we look at the  state of the literature on populism, its relation to the  Latin American experience, the evolution of the  approach to populism, and the conclusions we can  draw from these different perspectives. We conclude  that contemporary populism is also limited in the  same way the contextual approach to Latin American  populism was limited. This also helps us understand  why we still do not have a shared definition of  populism. Overall, we lack the balance between  generalisable and local definitions to help leaders  manage the contemporary violence of populism.},

How does Hungary perform under a government characterised by populist rhetoric? The study reveals that populism carries a significant economic cost, as GDP at equal purchasing power parity in 2020 is 10.04\% lower than a plausible alternative scenario where the current government was not elected, after a period of 10 years. Lack of addressing some persisting problems of the country, such as lack of competitiveness and institutional decay, might be the underlying dynamic in creating lasting damage to the economy. In this paper, we explore this topic using three different, but complementary techniques used to assess causality: Difference-in-Differences, Synthetic Difference-in-Differences, and the Synthetic Control Method.},

This paper is a configurational analysis that creates a new theoretical elaboration of populist parties in Europe in terms of policy choices. The forms of populism that we can see in contemporary Europe are new, relevant and do not have a theoretical representation in the literature. This paper also provides a clearer understanding of the characteristics of populist and anti-establishment parties in Europe, which can provide valuable insights into likely responses to reformed policy environments. To do so, the paper analyses policy positions connected to the populist literature for 242 parties in Europe in 2014 and 2019 using the Chapell Hill Expert Survey and the PopuList Survey data. Groups of parties with similarly held positions in 2014 and 2019 are identified using cluster analysis to investigate whether differences in positions are defined predominately according to a national, east–west, right–left faction or other criteria. The result highlights that rather than across a classical right–left divide connotation, Europe can be divided into four clusters: right-wing populists, a moderate pro-Europe left, a pro-Europe pro-liberalism centre and an intersectional left based on identity politics. Overall, the moderate left and the centrist liberalism centre are the most common parties across Europe, and the other two},

	abstract = {Lives Not Knives (LNK) is a youth-led charity with a mission to prevent knife crime, serious youth violence and school exclusions. As part of achieving these aims, the charity developed LNK Educate, which is a school-based programme that combines a universal workshop approach via a series of lessons with targeted one-to-one mentoring for young people.

Funded by the Youth Endowment Fund (YEF), the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) conducted a feasibility study and pilot study of LNK Educate. The feasibility study aimed to assess early programme implementation to support decisions about programme refinement and whether the evaluation should proceed to the pilot stage. Following this, the pilot study investigated the potential of LNK Educate to reduce the risk of youth offending and identify appropriate primary outcome measures for the intervention. Building on this, we present our assessment of the readiness of LNK Educate for a future trial and provide insights into how such a trial could be designed. This report presents the findings of both studies.},
