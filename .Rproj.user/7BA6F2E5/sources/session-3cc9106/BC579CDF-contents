::: {#hero-heading}
I am a researcher at [SciencesPo Paris](https://www.sciencespo.fr/centre-etudes-europeennes/en/researcher/elena-cossu.html) and for the Horizon [AuthLIB project](https://www.authlib.eu/consortium-members/). 

I am also a Senior Policy Evaluation Researcher for the [National Centre for Social Research](https://natcen.ac.uk/people/elena-cossu) in the UK.

My work is about applying data science techniques to political science and political economy. My current research is about using machine learning to classify illiberalism using text data.

Previously I worked on using experiments and quasi-experiments to measure the effects of a vast range of policies across Europe.

I am interested in using data to understand and help solve political problems.
